# Test Repository 02!

This is my second repository for learning Git using Github Codespaces.

## What am I doing now? 2025-08-26

I'm trying to find a consistent way to link my GitHub Codespaces environment with my GitHub repository. I am learning about git pull, git push, git remote, git fetch, etc.

And I actually learned how to connect my Codespace instance with my repository! I basically first created my Codespace instance, then I published it to Github by clicking the "Publish" button in the Codespace interface. This automatically linked my Codespace with my repository. Now I can just use git push and git pull to sync changes between my local Codespace and my GitHub repository.

I also learned to configure .gitignore so that the compiled executable files are not tracked by git. This keeps my repository clean and focused on source code. 

I learned to edit tasks.json so that I can run my C++ code directly from the Codespace terminal. This makes development faster and more efficient. I basically set up the cppbuild task to create the executable compiled cpp file in the main directory instead of the source directory.

I installed Live Server VSCode Extension to view live preview of my out.html file. I learned to make a basic HTML file named out.html and linked it with style.css. I'm planning to use this HTML file to visuallize anything I do with my main.cpp.

I made a new cpp source called chess.cpp. I will make a cpp program that I can use to play chess using standard chess notations as input. I aim to learn about cpp and OOP during this practice.

I'm using https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/templates/ as my source material for learning. I read Classes I and I will read Classes II tommorow.

I implemented drawing n-number polygon on a HTML file. I learned to use fstream and HTML Canvas. I created a file called htmlTemplate.ini to store basic HTML structure so that I can always recreate the intended out.html file.
