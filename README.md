# Test Repository 02!

This is my second repository for learning Git using Github Codespaces.

## What am I doing now? 2025-08-26

I'm trying to find a consistent way to link my GitHub Codespaces environment with my GitHub repository. I am learning about git pull, git push, git remote, git fetch, etc.

And I actually learned how to connect my Codespace instance with my repository! I basically first created my Codespace instance, then I published it to Github by clicking the "Publish" button in the Codespace interface. This automatically linked my Codespace with my repository. Now I can just use git push and git pull to sync changes between my local Codespace and my GitHub repository.
